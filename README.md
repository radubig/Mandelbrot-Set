# Mandelbrot-Set

**Code last updated on Mar 27, 2021** <br>
**Branch last cleaned on Jul 20, 2023**

A small program that renders the Mandelbrot Set in real-time using textures as color palettes. Supports scrolling, continuous zooming and color-changing effects from keyboard (see `main.cpp` for the list of keyboard commands).

The project uses the OpenGL API and is implemented with GLFW and GLEW. <br>
It was developed with Code::Blocks and compiled on the MinGW 32-bit compiler package that comes bundled with the IDE from `Code::Blocks 16.01`.

### Update: Jul 20, 2023

This branch contains the old version of the project that was meant to be compiled on the school's computers without any additional setups or dependencies. For this reason, this branch contains the old configuration files of the project targeted for an older version of Code::Blocks that came bundeled with a 32-bit g++ compiler, as well as manually compiled libraries for the graphics API.

You should only download the files from this branch if you intend to use the configuration described above for compiling the old version of the project. For an updated, cross-platform configuration checkout the `main` brach of this repository.
