# Mandelbrot-Set
(Work in progress)

A small program that renders the Mandelbrot Set in real-time using textures as color palettes. Supports scrolling, continuous zooming and color-changing effects from keyboard (see `main.cpp` for the list of keyboard commands).

The project uses the OpenGL API and is implemented with GLFW and GLEW. <br>
It was developed with Code::Blocks and compiled on a 32-bit MinGW compiler. If you use other compilers, change the corresponding GLFW and GLEW libraries. <br>
A premake file for building on other platforms will be provided in the future.
